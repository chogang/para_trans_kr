Here, here. Thanks, guys! Let me brief you in on the major structure and construction method of the weather tower... Huh?

Forget those - we're a team of professionals. Just share the floor plans.

Alright, y'all. Pack up your repellers and safety cables. We're headed to the towers.

Character Yun

High altitude guarantees freezing air, so watch your sleeves and collars.

Oi! You there! Watch it! If this knots up, things can go south real quick!

Looks good enough. Feels about the same if I close my eyes.

Roger. I'll do the same for the left, then... Speaking of which, why do you keep looking that-a way?

Nothing, I wonder how they're doing... Where is everybody?

Left for the tower half an hour ago. I mean... Come on.

I... Haha. I can't quite face the sight of my own arm getting taken apart.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Aha. Different folks come with different acceptance. It's more than counter-intuitive to ask a human to see cogs and springs inside them, so you can't blame anyone for not bearing the sight.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
However, I do have to say it's quite a rare symptom nowadays, as we're two hundred years into body mods. Let me see...

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 05嘴硬/辩解 Mid
DefaultText
Woah... Don't get started on your lectures again. It feels like when I first got a mod when I was a kid...

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
How did that prep shot treat you?

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 05嘴硬/辩解 Mid
DefaultText
What about it? What's wrong with not liking a needle under your skin?

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
No. I'm rather interested in what that feels like. You know, when you go through a lot of mods in a short period of time, you have to go through that many shots. You can still swing your arms around, but I think you're not supposed to feel anything starting from your neck.

Right. You hibernated with that chick for like what? Two decades?

What's with the stutter?

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid

Ugh... Where do I start...

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Back then, I lived with my parents in the lab. She was a kid from the orphanage nearby.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
The lab collabed with the orphanage in some way, so folks knew each other quite well.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
I wasn't exactly the most sporty kid, and my parents were quite worried about my safety. She did come around and play with me, though. She was the one that brought me all the interesting trinkets she found out there.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
She even sneaked me out for adventures. Bug catching, tree climbing, soccer... We weren't related in any way, but we sure felt... Connected.

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 02惊讶 Mid
DefaultText
Wait. I thought you said you didn't move around much.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Haha... Now that I think of it, it sure was wild. The two of us got scolded by the lab and the orphanage quite often.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
But hey. I was grateful for her presence in my life. Without her, I'd have been missing out on so many things that kids of that age were entitled to.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
She's... She's so very special to me.

Character Umar

Character Alkaid

Huh?

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 00底图 Mid

Like you said, you felt connected.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid
DefaultText
We weren't related, though.

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 00底图 Mid

Does that matter so much anyway?

Character Alkaid

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 00底图 Mid

Me and Mariah, we were from the orphanage as well. Nobody knew who our parents were, nor did anybody care.

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 00底图 Mid
DefaultText
I was quite a troublemaker back then. I fought her, and girl I fought hard. Bit by bit, we started to know each other.

Character Umar
Tachie ON 欧默 00底图 Mid

Now, she's my only family.

Character Alkaid
Tachie ON 摇光C4NEW 默认 Mid

So that's how.
