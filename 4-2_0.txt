How's it going on your end, Mariah?

Character Mariah

DefaultText
Every department has a few men down, and the security protocol is on lockdown. I tried all the emergency channels, but all is negative as of right now.

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Copy. I will connect to the global internet to send out distress signals.

Yes?

Character Corian
Tachie ON 珂莉安 05超大哭 Mid

Don't try to connect to the global internet! The security department tried that before, but that knocked them out like everyone else...…

Character Researcher A

Aw, shucks...

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

This means the global internet might be the bane of their coma...

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 03忍哭 Mid

Do we have to sit and wait then?

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

To think of it from another direction... If the problem lies in the global internet...

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 04认真 Mid

Do you mean...

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
No. Nothing. Gimme a hand, Mariah. Let turn our phone line into a local network.

Character Corian
Tachie ON 珂莉安 05超大哭 Mid
DefaultText
Before this, I'll go around to let everyone know not to try the global network.

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 04认真 Mid
DefaultText
Yeah. I'll trust you with scoping and gathering the coma units as well.

【Time flows by over and beside the tower, leaving the inside frozen and untouched for what feels like an eon.】

DefaultText
【Bit by bit, those trapped in this tower start to worry less about how long they have been kept inside. From time to time, a few of them gather at the ancient clock in the hall, waiting for a miracle to save them from the sea of boredom as the pointers collide again.】

【Corian, however, doesn't seem to fit into this slumber all too well. The lab never has been a rowdy place, but all the staff working around her gave her a quiet sense of liveliness nonetheless.】

I thought you were aiming for a tempo. I was waiting for that diss track to drop.

I'm not gonna do this again, I swear. And please. Go easier on that console...

Calm down. One thing at a time.

Character Researcher B
Tachie ON 研究员B 默认 Mid
DefaultText
He tried to rip prosthetics off those in coma! This is murdering!

Character Researcher C
Tachie ON 研究员C 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Murder, you say? My arm has missed so much maintenance that it went dead. What's the meaning of keeping those down if we can't make it out of here alive in the first place?

Character Researcher C
Tachie ON 研究员C 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Let reality sink in. Nobody's coming to save us. We are the only ones that can take them out alive! You! And Me!

I get it! I get it! Don't make me face this again!

Stop! Here. Use mine.

Character Researcher C
Tachie ON 研究员C 默认 Mid

How are you... Wait a minute. What was that?

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

I thought your arm was dead, right? Take mine.

Character Mariah

The dictating algorithm is a brain-structure computer with ample calculation power.

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

I planted in a sub system quarantined from all the discs. To a certain degree, this thing should be compatible with digitized brains.

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

I can upload my mind and carry over my life there. After that, feel free to pick whatever you want.

Character Researcher C
Tachie ON 研究员C 默认 Mid

No... No, no, no. I didn't mean that!

Character Researcher C
Tachie ON 研究员C 默认 Mid

I'm not gonna scrap for an arm ever again! Please don't do this! The rescue team will be here any minute! Don't give up. I beg you...

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Ha. The rescue team. When is that happening?

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
I know most of you have already lost track of how long we have been locked up in here, but I still remember! Thirty years! We were locked away for thirty years!

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

I can't wait a minute more... This is about all I care to do. I need a break...

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

That guy on the ground has no chance to consent, but I do. I can donate all my prosthetics for parts. Case closed.

You don't have to put it like that. You see, everyone here knows what you're talking about.

Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
…

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 04认真 Mid
This tower is practically a container of a whole house of broken people, and everyone knows that. Once prosthetics are taken for parts, it's gonna be a slippery slope from this point on.

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 04认真 Mid

By the time everything burns out, we'll go down together as a pack of barbarians mashing each other's brain out.

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 04认真 Mid

Better leave early before taking up too much resource for the young. So typical of an old mind.

Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Say, have you got many life regrets so far?

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 04认真 Mid
DefaultText
Not that I can finish counting them by the end of the day, which is why I can't say yes to any self sacrifices. An upload with the technology we've got? You get practically no chance for a recovery.

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Right. Slimmer chance than making it out of here.

Character Mariah
Tachie ON 玛莉亚 03忍哭 Mid
DefaultText
You've got a few undone wishes as well, don't you?

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid
DefaultText
Yeah. About as many as yours if not more.

Character Researcher A
Tachie ON 研究员A 默认 Mid

No sacrifices, then nobody gets to walk out of here alive. Not even a single wish matters anymore.

I can't leave Corian alone, but I don't have enough core parts left in me to be worthy of any resources anymore. Leave it for the other two...

I still remember how I told her the story of the elephant graveyard. We're behaving exactly the same, not that I'm comparing these fine ladies to elephants...

Right. Not as much as 500 years old yet. Still fine ladies at their prime.

Please, oh please. Talk to me. Don't make me cry out loud... If Corian sees me going out crying, she'll get scared, too.
